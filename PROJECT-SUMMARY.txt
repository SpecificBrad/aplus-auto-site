  Time Saved: 2-3 hours/week vs. NLClassifieds posting
  ROI: Increased visibility, better conversion, professional image
  Pricing: $800-1,200 (one-time) + optional $50/month maintenance

NEXT STEPS FOR YOU:
  1. Open index.html in browser - TEST IT
  2. Deploy to Netlify (follow DEPLOYMENT.md)
  3. Visit A+ Auto Centre with demo
  4. Show owner on your laptop/phone

  📋 Add real photos & content (2 hours)
  📋 Final testing & deployment (1 hour)
  ────────────────────────────────────────────
  TOTAL: 13-16 additional hours

YOUR REVENUE MODEL:
  Base site: $800-1,200 (covers 15-19 hours build time)
  Maintenance: $50/month (update inventory, add vehicles)
  Target: 2-3 clients/month = $2,400-3,600/month

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE:
  ✓ Their current site is BROKEN
  ✓ You're LOCAL (on their delivery route)
  ✓ Spec site already built (removes their risk)
  ✓ Professional design (competes with big dealers)
  ✓ Mobile-optimized (where car shoppers are)

KEY PITCH POINTS:
  • "Your website returns a 403 error - customers can't see it"
  • "I built you this on spec - it's already done"
  • "Way easier than posting to NLClassifieds individually"
  • "Mobile-optimized - most car buyers are on phones"
  • "I can have it live this week"

YOUR CONFIDENCE BUILDERS:
  ✓ You already built Vital Illumination (complex, humanitarian site)
  ✓ You built Alberta oilfield company site
  ✓ You know Claude Code / "vibe coding"
  ✓ This architecture is SOLID
  ✓ Demo looks professional

  • Portfolio piece
  • Proven system that works
  • Next business to pitch
  • Experience with spec websites
  • GitHub repo to show others

BEST CASE SCENARIO:
  They say yes → You have:
  • $800-1,200 this week
