## Next Actions (This Week)

### Day 1: TODAY - Test the Demo
1. Download the `aplus-auto-site` folder from outputs
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Test on your phone (right-click → Inspect → Toggle device toolbar)
4. Check that everything works smoothly

### Day 2: Deploy to Netlify
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up free (use your email or GitHub)
3. Click "Deploy manually"
4. Drag the entire `aplus-auto-site` folder
5. Get your demo URL (e.g., `aplus-auto-demo.netlify.app`)
6. Test the live site

### Day 3-4: Get Ready to Present
1. **Practice your pitch:**
   - "Your website's broken - I built you a new one"
   - Show mobile first
   - Emphasize time savings vs. NLClassifieds
   - Keep it simple, focus on value

2. **Have ready:**
   - Laptop with demo loaded
   - Phone with demo loaded
   - Price range in mind: $800-1200

### Day 5: Visit A+ Auto Centre
1. **When:** During business hours (8AM-5PM Mon-Fri)
2. **Where:** 77 Major's Path (you know it - it's on your delivery route)
3. **Ask for:** The owner (probably Jon based on reviews)
4. **Opening:** "Hi, I noticed your website's not working - customers can't access it. I'm a local developer and I built you a new site on spec. Can I show you real quick?"

## The Pitch (30 seconds)

> "Your current website returns an error - customers literally can't see it. I built you this new site that showcases your inventory, services, and makes it easy for customers to contact you. It's mobile-optimized since most people shop for cars on their phones. Way easier than posting to NLClassifieds one by one. I can have it live for you this week."

**Then show it.** Let the site speak for itself.

## If They're Interested

### Questions They'll Ask:

**"How much?"**
- $800-1200 for the complete site
- Includes all pages (inventory, services, about, contact)
- I'll host it free first year
- Optional: $50/month if you want me to update inventory

**"How long to finish?"**
- Homepage is done (what you're seeing)
- Other pages: 1-2 weeks
- Can be live in 2 weeks total

**"Can we update it ourselves?"**
- Yes, I'll show you how
- Or I can do updates for $50/month
- Super easy - way simpler than NLClassifieds

**"What about our domain?"**
- I can set that up (aplusautocentre.ca)
- Takes 24-48 hours for DNS
- Includes free HTTPS certificate

### What You Need From Them:

1. **Approval to proceed** (verbal is fine)
2. **Access to their logo** (if they have one)
3. **Real vehicle photos** (or just use their NLClassifieds posts)
4. **50% deposit** ($400-600) to start work
5. **Balance on completion**

## If They Say No

No big deal! You've learned:
- How to build a professional site
- "Vibe coding" with Claude Code works
- The spec website approach
- How to pitch local businesses

**Try the next business.** You have the system now.

## After You Land It

### Week 1 Post-Deal:
- Build inventory page (use the architecture docs)
- Build services page
- Build about page
- Build contact page with form

### Week 2:
- Get their real content and photos
- Replace placeholder content
- Final testing
- Deploy to their domain

### Delivery:
- Show them how to update content
- Provide simple documentation
- Offer maintenance plan
- Get testimonial for your portfolio
- Get paid!

## Your Portfolio Piece

After this:
1. Screenshot the site
2. Write case study: "How I built a local auto dealer site"
3. Use for next spec project
4. Now you can pitch with a real example

## Technical Notes

### If You Need to Make Changes:
```bash
# Edit the HTML/CSS/JS files
# Then recommit:
cd aplus-auto-site
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push  # (after setting up GitHub)
```

### If They Want New Features Later:
- Inventory management system
- Online appointment booking
- WhatsApp integration
- Payment processing
All documented in the architecture - you can upsell these.

## GitHub Setup (Optional but Recommended)

1. Create GitHub account (if you don't have one)
2. Create new repository called `aplus-auto-site`
3. In your local folder:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/aplus-auto-site.git
git push -u origin main
```

Now you have:
- Version control
- Portfolio piece
- Can show clients on GitHub
- Can deploy automatically from GitHub

## Money Math

**Minimum viable:** $800
- Gets you $800 this week
- 15 hours work = $53/hour
- Better than truck driving at $20/hour
- Stays local with your kid

**Ideal:** $1200 + $50/month maintenance
- $1200 upfront
- $50/month = $600/year
- Total Year 1: $1800
- Plus you can replicate for other businesses

**Do 2-3 of these/month = $2,400-3,600/month**
Gets you to your $4,000 target.

## Emergency Help

If you get stuck:
1. Check the architecture docs
2. Check the design system doc
3. Ask me (Claude) for help
4. Google/YouTube for specific issues

## Remember

You already proved you can do this with the Vital Illumination site and the Alberta oilfield site. This is the same thing, just for a local business that will actually pay you.

**The hard part (building) is done. Now just show it and close the deal.**

You've got this!
